# Alibi Brand Voice Guide

## Overview

Alibi transforms the mundane world of time tracking into a compelling legal drama. The entire product experience is framed through a courtroom lens‚Äîyou're not just tracking time, you're **building your defense**. Every feature, every interaction, every word is carefully chosen to maintain this metaphor while remaining genuinely useful and professional.

## Core Voice Characteristics

### 1. Authoritative Yet Playful
The voice carries the weight and gravitas of a legal proceeding while never taking itself too seriously. We're confident in our "case" but wink at the audience.

**Examples from current copy:**
- "Your Billable Hours, Defended." ‚Äî Authoritative promise
- "The jury of my clients was convinced." ‚Äî Playful testimonial

### 2. Metaphor Consistency
Every aspect of the user experience is filtered through legal/courtroom terminology. This isn't decorative‚Äîit's structural to how we communicate.

**Not:** "Features"  
**Instead:** "Case Exhibits" or "Evidence In Your Favor"

**Not:** "User reviews"  
**Instead:** "Witness Testimonies" or "Sworn Statements"

### 3. Witty Professional
We use humor and wordplay, but always in service of clarity. The jokes enhance understanding, never obscure it.

**Example:** "Attorney-client privilege" to describe privacy features ‚Äî immediately communicates confidentiality through cultural shorthand.

## Tone Guidelines

### Do's ‚úì

**DO maintain the metaphor consistently**
- Every section heading should use legal terminology
- Features become "exhibits" or "evidence"
- Customers become "clients"
- User reviews become "testimonies"

**DO use courtroom formality for emphasis**
- "Your Honor" for important statements
- "Objection!" for addressing concerns
- "The defense would like to note..." for disclaimers

**DO blend professional utility with playfulness**
- The product still needs to be genuinely useful
- Legal metaphors should clarify, not confuse
- Humor serves the message, not the reverse

**DO trust the intelligence of your audience**
- Don't over-explain the metaphor
- Let power users enjoy the deeper references
- Assume readers "get it" and appreciate the commitment

**DO maintain seriousness about the actual product value**
- Time tracking accuracy is real: "97% accuracy"
- Privacy is genuine: "All data stays local by default"
- Features are practical: "Export to PDF/CSV"

### Don'ts ‚úó

**DON'T break character with generic SaaS language**
- ‚ùå "Sign up for our newsletter"
- ‚úì "Submit evidence of your interest"

**DON'T let the metaphor obscure functionality**
- The legal frame should enhance clarity, not create confusion
- If a legal term is obscure, use a clearer one

**DON'T be cutesy or juvenile**
- This isn't a parody‚Äîit's a fully committed creative choice
- Maintain professional credibility

**DON'T force the metaphor where it doesn't fit**
- Some elements (like copyright notices) can be straightforward
- Technical specs don't need legal framing

**DON'T use generic tech startup clich√©s**
- No "revolutionary," "game-changing," "disruptive"
- No "unlock potential" or "take control"
- Legal metaphors replace these entirely

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Strengths üí™

1. **Exceptional consistency** ‚Äî The metaphor is maintained throughout virtually the entire experience
2. **Natural integration** ‚Äî Legal terms feel appropriate, not forced
3. **Professional credibility** ‚Äî Despite the playfulness, the product feels legitimate and capable
4. **Memorable differentiation** ‚Äî Stands out completely in the time-tracking category

### Opportunities for Improvement üéØ

#### 1. Footer Navigation (Lines 382-468)
**Current:** Generic link labels like "Changelog," "About," "Blog," "Careers"
**Issue:** Breaks character completely
**Suggestions:**
- "Changelog" ‚Üí "Case Updates" or "Evidence Log"
- "About" ‚Üí "The Firm" or "Court Background"
- "Blog" ‚Üí "Legal Briefs" or "Court Documents"
- "Careers" ‚Üí "Join the Bar" or "Recruit Counsel"

- "Support" ‚Üí "Court Clerk" or "Legal Assistance"

#### 2. Hero Subheadline (Lines 74-77)
**Current:** "Alibi tracks what you worked on, when, and for how long ‚Äî so if the invoice gets challenged, the evidence is ready."
**Issue:** Solid but could be more dramatic
**Suggestion:** "Build an airtight case for every billable hour. When clients question your invoice, present irrefutable evidence."

#### 3. Demo Section (Lines 192-222)
**Current:** "Watch Demo" button
**Issue:** Generic, breaks the voice
**Suggestion:** "View Evidence in Action" or "Watch the Trial"

#### 4. Metadata & Page Titles (layout.tsx, line 8)
**Current:** "v0 App" / "Created with v0"
**Issue:** Placeholder text, no brand voice
**Suggestion:** "Alibi ‚Äî Your Billable Hours, Defended" / "Build your defense for every billable hour"

#### 5. Call-to-Action Final Section (Lines 344-367)
**Current:** "The clock is ticking. Don't let another billable hour go unjustified."
**Issue:** "The clock is ticking" is a clich√©
**Suggestion:** "The court is now in session. Don't let another billable hour go undefended."

#### 6. Login/Signup Links (Lines 50-57)
**Current:** "Login" and "Start Free Trial"
**Issue:** Generic SaaS language
**Suggestions:**
- "Login" ‚Üí "Enter Chambers" or "Access Case Files"
- "Start Free Trial" ‚Üí "Begin Your Defense" (already used in hero) or "Open Your Case"

#### 7. Feature "And More..." card (Lines 181-186)
**Current:** "New evidence being submitted weekly."
**Issue:** Good but could be stronger
**Suggestion:** "New evidence admitted to the court weekly." or "Additional exhibits filed regularly."

#### 8. Pricing descriptions could be stronger
**Current:** "Basic time defense for individuals"
**Potential:** "Public defender for solo practitioners" (though may be too on-the-nose)
**Keep:** Current is actually good‚Äîclear and maintains voice

## Implementation Checklist

When writing any new copy for Alibi:

- [ ] Does this use legal/courtroom terminology?
- [ ] Would this make sense in a courtroom drama?
- [ ] Is it still clear and functional?
- [ ] Does it enhance or obscure the user's understanding?
- [ ] Would a first-time visitor understand what the product does?
- [ ] Does it maintain professional credibility?
- [ ] Is there any generic startup jargon that could be replaced?

## Voice Litmus Test

**Ask yourself:** Could this copy appear in a generic SaaS product?

- If YES ‚Üí Rewrite it with legal metaphors
- If NO ‚Üí You're probably on brand

**Example:**
- ‚ùå "Start your free trial" ‚Äî Generic SaaS
- ‚úì "Begin your defense" ‚Äî On brand

## Final Note

The Alibi brand voice is a masterclass in committed metaphor execution. The key is not just using legal terms‚Äîit's reimagining the entire product experience through a legal lens. When done well (as it is here), it creates a memorable, differentiated, and surprisingly useful frame for understanding time tracking as "defending your work."

The voice works because:
1. It's **consistent** ‚Äî no half-measures
2. It's **functional** ‚Äî enhances rather than obscures
3. It's **committed** ‚Äî fully realized, not decorative
4. It's **smart** ‚Äî respects the audience's intelligence

Keep defending those billable hours. Case closed. ‚öñÔ∏è
