## 🎯 What This Is

**Alibi** is an open-source demonstration of exceptional brand voice execution. The entire product experience—from hero copy to footer links—maintains a consistent legal/courtroom metaphor that transforms mundane time tracking into a compelling narrative.

This project showcases:
- **Committed metaphor execution** — Every word reinforces the legal theme
- **Functional creativity** — The voice enhances, never obscures, usability
- **Professional playfulness** — Witty without being juvenile
- **Differentiation through voice** — Stands out completely in a crowded category

## ⚖️ Why This Matters

Most products treat brand voice as decoration—a thin layer of personality on top of generic copy. Alibi demonstrates what happens when voice becomes **structural**: when every interaction, every microcopy element, every call-to-action flows from a single creative decision.

The result isn't just memorable—it's a masterclass in:
- Consistent metaphor application
- Category differentiation
- Emotional engagement
- User experience enhancement through voice

## 🔍 Key Brand Voice Features

### The Legal Frame

Everything is filtered through courtroom terminology:
- Features → **"Case Exhibits"** and **"Evidence"**
- Testimonials → **"Sworn Statements"** from **"Witnesses"**
- Pricing → **"Retainer Fees"** to **"Retain Services"**
- Support → **"Court Clerk"**
- Documentation → **"Case Files"**
- FAQ → **"Cross-Examination"**

### Voice Characteristics

1. **Authoritative yet playful** — Carries legal gravitas without taking itself too seriously
2. **Metaphor consistency** — Every element maintains the courtroom frame
3. **Witty professional** — Humor serves clarity, never obscures it
4. **Intelligent** — Trusts the audience to appreciate the commitment

### What Makes It Work

- **Functional metaphors:** Legal terms actually clarify what features do
- **No breaking character:** Even footer links maintain the voice
- **Professional credibility:** Despite playfulness, the product feels legitimate
- **Cultural resonance:** Legal/courtroom imagery is universally understood
